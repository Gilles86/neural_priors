welcome1:
  Welcome to the experiment!
  This experiment, your job is to indicate how many dots are in the cloud.
  You will do this by moving the slider to the left or right.

intro_block:
  NOTE: in this part of the experiment, the number of dots in the cloud will always be
   between {range_lower} and {range_higher}.

intro_part1: 
  In this FIRST part of the block, we will show you 15 examples of possible
  clouds of dots and also show you the actual number below. This allows
  you to adapt to the estimation task.

intro_part2:
  In this SECOND part of the block  it is your task to estimate the number of dots of 30 clouds
  and report using the slider.
  We will give you feedback on how many dots were actually in the cloud after each estimation.

intro_part3:
  In this THIRD part of the experiment, you will again have to esimate the number of dots in the cloud.
  However, this time, we will not give you feedback on the actual number of dots in the cloud.
